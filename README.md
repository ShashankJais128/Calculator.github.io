# Calculator.github.io
We use calculators in our daily life, not only the simple calculator which is used for arithmetic calculations but also	different ones like bmi calculator, tip calculator, etc. In this project I am going to make a website where one can do all the calculations in a single place. I am going to design	this website using HTML and CSS and use Javascript for writing the functions to perform necessary calculations. I am going to make the website responsive so that users donâ€™t face any difficulty using it in their mobile phones.
